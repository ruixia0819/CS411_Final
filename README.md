### Introduction

```
Our application is designed to help you make decisions for deciding a place for meal, which helps those who has OCD in making food decision. Unlike common recipe recommendation App, we do not simply providing information to you, we are trying to make choice for you. It recommends restaurants for users based on preference Q&A and users' meal history by applying machine learning algorithm. It will be similar to some other restaurant rating or recommendation applications like Yelp, but not the same because it is not only a list of restaurant information but most importantly, a decision maker of what to eat. Users can login their account after creating a username and password. They can filter out restaurants by answering some questions regarding their preferences. Users can also post messages to invite their friends to join their meal together. We also built a function to display location of restaurants and their friends, as well as their current location and routes to different restaurants.
